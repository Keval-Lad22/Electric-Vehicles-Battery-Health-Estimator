# Electric-Vehicles-Battery-Health-Estimator

This project uses machine learning to predict the battery health of electric vehicles based on:
- Charge Cycles
- Average Temperature
- Average Voltage
- Usage Pattern (Urban / Highway / Mixed)

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)

##  Output
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- RÂ² Score
- Live prediction from user input
